# Getting Started

## Quick Start from Template

### Deploy to Vercel

You can start by creating your own Nextra site and deploying to Vercel by
clicking the link:

<a
  className="mt-3 inline-flex"
  target="_blank"
  href="https://vercel.com/new/clone?s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshuding%2Fnextra-docs-template&showOptionalTeamCreation=false"
>
  ![](https://vercel.com/button)
</a>

Vercel will fork the
[Nextra Docs template](https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template) and
deploy the site for you. Once done, every commit in the repository will be
deployed automatically.

### Fork the Template

You can also manually fork the
[template repository](https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template).

## Start as New Project

<Steps>
### Install

To create a Nextra Docs site manually, you have to install **Next.js**,
**React**, **Nextra**, and **Nextra Docs Theme**. In your project directory, run
the following command to install the dependencies:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i next react react-dom virtual-support virtual-support-provider
```

<Callout>
  If you already have Next.js installed in your project, you only need to
  install `virtual-support` and `virtual-support-provider` as the add-ons.
</Callout>

Add the following scripts in `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
},
```

You can either start the server with, for example if you use npm, `npm run dev`,
which will run in development mode or `npm run build && npm run start` for
production mode.

<Callout>
  If you're not familiar with Next.js, note that development mode is
  significantly slower since Next.js compiles every page you navigate to.
</Callout>

### Add Next.js Config

Create the following `next.config.js` file in your project‚Äôs root directory:

```js filename="next.config.js"
const withNextra = require("nextra")({
  theme: "nextra-theme-docs",
  themeConfig: "./theme.config.jsx",
});

module.exports = withNextra();

// If you have other Next.js configurations, you can pass them as the parameter:
// module.exports = withNextra({ /* other next.js config */ })
```

With the above configuration, Nextra can handle Markdown files in your Next.js
project, with the specified theme. Other Nextra configurations can be found in
[Guide](/docs/guide).

### Create Docs Theme Config

Lastly, create the corresponding `theme.config.jsx` file in your project‚Äôs root
directory. This will be used to configure the Nextra Docs theme:

```jsx filename="theme.config.jsx"
export default {
  logo: <span>My Nextra Documentation</span>,
  project: {
    link: "https://github.com/shuding/nextra",
  },
  // ... other theme options
};
```

Full theme configurations can be found
[here](/docs/docs-theme/theme-configuration).

### Ready to Go!

Now, you can create your first MDX page as `pages/index.mdx`:

```mdx filename="pages/index.mdx"
# Welcome to Nextra

Hello, world!
```

And run the `next` or `next dev` command specified in `package.json`to start
developing the project! üéâ

</Steps>

Next, check out the next section to learn about organizing the documentation
structure and configuring the website theme:

## File structure

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="pages" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="contact.md" />
    <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="about" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Example

### Code

```js filename="counters.tsx" {5-17} copy
export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)} className={styles.counter}>
        Clicked {count} times
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Component

export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)} className={styles.counter}>
        Clicked {count} times
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

<Counter />

## External Component

import Counters from "../../../components/counters";

<Counters />

## Quick Start

To start using Nextra, you need to select a theme first:

<Cards num={2}>
  <Cards.Card
    image
    arrow
    title="Documentation theme"
    href="/docs/docs-theme/start"
  >
    <>![Documentation theme](/assets/docs-theme.png)</>
  </Cards.Card>
  <Cards.Card image arrow title="Blog theme" href="/docs/blog-theme/start">
    <>![Blog theme](/assets/blog-theme.png)</>
  </Cards.Card>
</Cards>

If you want to use Nextra without using these built-in themes, you can follow
the [Custom Theme](/docs/custom-theme) docs.

## Virtual Assistance FAQ

The FAQ is a collection of useful questions and answers about the
tool. If you have a question that isn't answered here, please
[open a discussion](https://github.com/osmanity/Osmanity_v6/discussions).

export function FAQBox({ title, children }) {
  return (
    <details
      open
      className="last-of-type:mb-0 rounded-lg bg-neutral-50 dark:bg-neutral-800 p-2 mt-4"
    >
      <summary>
        <strong className="text-lg">{title}</strong>
      </summary>
      <div className="nx-p-2">{children}</div>
    </details>
  );
}

<FAQBox title="Can I use Nextra with Next.js app router?">
  No, Nextra only works with the `/pages` directory at the moment. Support for
  the app router has not been implemented yet. But you can use `/app` and
  `/pages` at the same time - just put your docs inside `/pages` and your other
  routes in `/app`
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Can I use X with Nextra?">
  The answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù for most things. Since Nextra is just a Next.js plugin, almost all the things
  that can be done with React can be done with Nextra. Here are some examples and guides:

- [Use Tailwind CSS](/docs/guide/tailwind-css)
- [Use custom CSS and Sass](/docs/guide/custom-css)
- [Use custom fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How can I add a live coding component in Nextra?">
  There are libraries like [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io) and
  [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) that can help you
  add live coding components to your MDX.
